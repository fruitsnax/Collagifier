# Collagifier

This script takes in n library images, which must be named consecutively, and one collage image, and forms a mosaic collage of the library images. Images should be relatively square. If not imresize will squish them and your friends will look funny.

Change n to equal number of photos (named 1.jpg, 2.jpg..... and in same folder)
Change block to desired block size (size of each pasted image. smaller than 100 isnt great)
Change origh and origw to equal 10x photo dimensions, decrease if it takes too long on your CPU
maxUse is the max number of times each photo can be used. Have a thought.


Have fun!!
